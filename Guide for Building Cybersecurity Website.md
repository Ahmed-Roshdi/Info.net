### This file has Created For AI Models: please Attincion: 

**Primary Objective:**
Develop the complete "Cybersecurity" section for a personal portfolio website. The development must strictly follow the final approved plan, the "No Shared Files" policy, and the new auto-switch-to-dark-mode functionality.

**Critical Rule 1: No Shared Files**
Each HTML page must link to its own dedicated and separate CSS and JavaScript files. There will be absolutely no shared resources between different pages. This is to ensure complete isolation and prevent any style or script conflicts.

**Critical Rule 2: Adherence to Final Plan**
The design and functionality must be based *only* on the "Cybersecurity Page Development Plan - Final Version". Any previously discussed ideas, such as a "boot screen," are explicitly discarded and must not be implemented.

### **Required File Structure (12 Files Total)**

Create the following file structure without deviation:

*   **English Light Mode:**
    *   `cybersecurity.html`
    *   `cybersecurity.css`
    *   `cybersecurity.js`

*   **English Dark Mode (The Core Experience):**
    *   `cybersecurity-darkmode.html`
    *   `cybersecurity-darkmode.css`
    *   `cybersecurity-darkmode.js`

*   **Arabic Light Mode:**
    *   `cybersecurity-ar.html`
    *   `cybersecurity-ar.css`
    *   `cybersecurity-ar.js`

*   **Arabic Dark Mode:**
    *   `cybersecurity-ar-darkmode.html`
    *   `cybersecurity-ar-darkmode.css`
    *   `cybersecurity-ar-darkmode.js`

### **Step-by-Step Development Plan**

**Phase 1: Build the English Dark Mode (`cybersecurity-darkmode.html`)**

This is the primary and most complex version.

*   **Goal:** Create the full "Elegant Hacker Experience."
*   **Design:** Mysterious, technical, and inspired by Hacker UI. (like Dark-Web Hackers websites)
*   **Color Palette:** Use a black background, a primary Neon Green color for text/icons, and Red/Yellow accents.
*   **Fonts:** Use a high-quality Monospace font.
*   **Structure & Interactivity (According to the final plan only):**
    1.  **Main Dashboard:** A grid of interactive widgets including a profile with a glitch effect, a skills matrix, animated live stats, and an animated threat map.
    2.  **Operations Log:** A section that simulates a terminal, where case studies appear as if being typed out.
    3.  **Tools Arsenal:** A grid of tool icons with a glowing effect on hover.

**Phase 2: Build the English Light Mode (`cybersecurity.html`)**

*   **Goal:** Create a clean, professional alternative that serves as an entry point to the dark mode experience.
*   **Design:** Professional, clean, and easy to read.
*   **Color Palette:** Use a white/light gray background with professional blue or dark gray text.
*   **Structure:** Display the same information as dark mode but using a traditional layout with clean cards and lists.
*   **NEW MANDATORY FUNCTIONALITY:**
    *   **Implement an automatic redirect.** When a user first visits this page, a JavaScript timer should start. After 7 seconds, the page must automatically redirect to `cybersecurity-darkmode.html`.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is to showcase the beauty of the cybersecurity world in its intended dark mode.
    *   **User Freedom:** The user can then navigate back to the light mode page (`cybersecurity.html`) if they choose, and the automatic redirect should **not** trigger again during their session (use `sessionStorage` to prevent this).

**Phase 3: Build the Arabic Versions (`-ar` files)**

*   **Goal:** Create direct, un-shared counterparts to the English versions with perfect RTL support.
*   **HTML Files:** Translate all text content accurately into Arabic.
*   **CSS Files:** Duplicate the styles from their respective English CSS files, then modify them to fully support a **Right-to-Left (RTL)** layout. Pay close attention to text alignment, margins, padding, and element positioning.
*   **`cybersecurity-ar.js`:** Implement the same 7-second automatic redirect functionality as the English light mode, but make it redirect to `cybersecurity-ar-darkmode.html`. Ensure it also uses `sessionStorage` to only run once per session.

**Final Instructions:**
*   Ensure all navigation elements (language switcher, dark/light mode toggle) link to the correct, separate HTML files.
*   Package all 12 completed and tested files into a single compressed file for delivery.Of course. I understand completely. You want the final, polished prompt in English, with a new, specific instruction added to it: the light mode pages should automatically switch to dark mode after a few seconds to showcase the "true" experience, while still giving the user the freedom to switch back.

I have also removed the "Cybersecurity Portfolio" title as requested.

Here is the complete, final command in one message, ready to be used.

### **Important Details: Header Navigation Logic**

A "Home" button must be present in the header of all `cybersecurity` pages. This button's function is to return the user to the main homepage (`index`), but its specific destination link must be context-aware, depending on the user's current language and theme.

The navigation logic must be implemented as follows:

*   If the user is on `cybersecurity.html` (English, Light Mode), the "Home" button must link to **`index.html`**.
*   If the user is on `cybersecurity-darkmode.html` (English, Dark Mode), the "Home" button must link to **`index-darkmode.html`**.
*   If the user is on `cybersecurity-ar.html` (Arabic, Light Mode), the "Home" button must link to **`index-ar.html`**.
*   If the user is on `cybersecurity-ar-darkmode.html` (Arabic, Dark Mode), the "Home" button must link to **`index-ar-darkmode.html`**.

This ensures a seamless user experience, maintaining their chosen theme and language when they return to the main page. All `index` files are assumed to be ready and available.
